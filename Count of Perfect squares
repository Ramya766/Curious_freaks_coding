Consider a sample space consisting of all perfect squares starting from 1, 4, 9 and so on. You are given a number n, you have to find the number of integers less than n in the sample space.

Examples :

Input: n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2.

program:
class Solution {
    static int countSquares(int n) {
        int count =0;
        for(int i=1;i*i<n;i++){
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
